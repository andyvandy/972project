    "### 1. Introduction \n",
    "- Authors seek online wealth investment strategies which enable an investor to maximize his wealth by distributing it on a set of available financial instruments \n",
    "- No statistical assumptions about the behaviour of the market \n",
    "- Market is allowed to be adversarial \n",
    "- Goal: maximize wealth relative to that achieved by the constant rebalanced portfolio (CRP)\n",
    "- In addition to maximizing wealth, the authors are also concerned with computational efficiency \n",

    "#### Constant-rebalanced Portfolio\n",
    "- A CRP strategy rebalances the wealth each trading period to have a fixed proportion in every stock in the portfolio \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measuring Strategy Performance \n",
    "- Regret:\n",
    "    - The relative difference between the logarithmic growth ratio achieved over the entire trading period, and that achieved by a prescient investor (one who knows market outcomes in advance)\n",
    "- An investment strategy universal if it achieves sublinear regret \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Past Work \n",
    "- Universal portfolio management algorithms have been optimal with respect to regret, but computationally inefficient (Cover, 1991), or efficient but obtained suboptimal regret (Helmbold et al. 1998)\n",
    "- Recent works have remedied this issue (Agarwal and Hazan, 2005), and have been successfully generalized\n",
    "- Current successful algorithms are based on the follow the leader method, a strategy which advocates the use of the best strategy so far in the next iteration (trading period)\n",
    "- This paper brings out the connection between follow-the-leader to the Newton Method for offline optimization \n",
    "\n",

    "- The best Constant Rebalanced Portfolio in hindsight $p^{*}$ is the one which maximizes the logarithmic growth ratio \n",
    "- Mathematically, one can define regret at follows:\n",

    "- Key Assumptions:\n",
    "    - WLOG the authors assume thta $r_{t}$ is scaled to that $max_{j}r_{t}(j) = 1$\n",
    "    - Additionally, it is assumed that after scaling $r_{t}$, all the $r_{t}(j)$ are bounded below by the market variability parameter $\\alpha > 0$\n",
